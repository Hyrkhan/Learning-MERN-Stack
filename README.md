# MERN Stack Learning Repository

Welcome to my MERN stack learning repository! This project contains various examples and exercises that I am working on as I learn the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).

## Getting Started

To get started with this project locally, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
