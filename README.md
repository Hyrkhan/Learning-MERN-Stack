# MERN Stack Learning Repository

Welcome to my MERN stack learning repository! This project contains various examples and exercises that I am working on as I learn the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).

## Getting Started

To get started with this project locally, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which includes npm)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (if applicable for the project)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) (this will be the frontend)
- [CORS Middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) (for enabling CORS in your Node.js backend and ensuring communication between frontend and backend)

## Tutorial

I'm also just following a tutorial on YouTube made by Net Ninja
